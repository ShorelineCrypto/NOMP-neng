# NOMP-neng - A Solo Pool for Nengcoin
#### Node Open Mining Portal

This pool is adapted from Garlicoin NOMP dockerhub image and its source code.

Nengcoin solo pool running in many different homes of Nengcoin miners will increase decentralization and resiliance of Nengcoin network.

In general, solo private pool mining for Nengcoin is recommended and should be more profitable for average joe's scrypt USB ASIC devices
that lack the hash power compared to big litecoin/doge big rigs at public pools. 

## Installation

Please follow step by step installation guide in INSTALL.md file for setup the solo pool
